# Swipe
The idea of this project is to find if there is a tendency between unconscious swiping direction and speed in UX and the user's preference. Tinder demonstrated a very successful example of associating user preference and UX. Tinder train users to swipe left if they do not like the match, and right if they like. Also, some research claims that eye gaze direction is related to inhabited behavior or subconscious desires.

To learn user preference more precisely, Swipe! shows the user some series of random images. Given straightforward direction, 'Swipe LEFT if you do NOT like the image, Swipe RIGHT if you DO like the image,' Users freely swipe the images, Swipe record the angle, speed of swiping, and analyze them at the end. 
    
Swipe! referenced [Swing by gajus](https://github.com/gajus/swing) for the javascript UI.
